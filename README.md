# simplecurses++

A simple, opinionated, header-only C++ wrapper for [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)).

# Prerequisites

* A [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)) library like [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses)
* C++11
* Doxygen (for documentation only)

# Building

There is no building (other than the Doxygen). You just need to simply
include the single header:

```
#include <simplecurses++.hh>
```

If you want to build the Doxygen, you simple need to run `make docs`.

# Example

An example of usage is found in [example.cpp](example.cpp).
